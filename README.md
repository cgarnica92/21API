# Blackjack Game project. 

In this project we created a Blackjack game utilizing a Deck of Cards API (www.deckofcardsapi.com), an Exchange Rate API (www.exchangerate.host), and Tailwind CSS (www.tailwindcss.com) along with JQuery (www.jquery.com) for styling. The game starts with a set amount of $500 and deals the player 2 cards followed by the dealer. There is a currency exchange provided using the dollar amount in different currencies. After the round is complete the player is given the option to quit or restart for a second round.  

## Actions Taken: 
* Delegated roles and responsibilities to break up assignment into tasks and responsibilities. 
* Used Tailwind CSS to implement styling and layout of the game. 
* Used Deck of cards API for the gameplay and logic and to display cards. 
* Used the Forex API to show and compare the dollar amount against different currencies. 
* Used JQuery to implement the user interface.
